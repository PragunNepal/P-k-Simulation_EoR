# P(k) Plot Simulation - HI Map Simulation EoR
1. Open the Python Notebook File
2. Make the necessary changes - file path, your animation name, among others
3. The simulation is ready to run

The simulation is of P(k) vs k plot for the HI map simulation - Reionization.
Since the original code was run on Jupyter Notebook, I recommend to use the same. The rendering time depends from ~10 minutes to ~25 minutes.
